    "**Important Notes**:\n",
    "1. Be sure to **document** all of your decisions, as well as your intermediate and final results. Make sure your conclusions and analyses are clearly presented. Don't make us dig into your code or walls of printed results to try to draw conclusions from your code.\n",
    "2. If you use code from someone else (e.g. Github, Stack Overflow, ChatGPT, etc) you **must be transparent about it**. Document your sources and explain how you adapted any partial solutions to creat **your** solution.\n",

    "We will do this in steps using a Multilayer Perceptron on MNIST.\n",

    "\n",
    "+ I have provided some **starter** code at the beginning. **NONE** of this code should survive in your solutions. Not only is it **very** badly written, it is also written in my functional style that also obfuscates what it's doing (in part to **discourage** your reuse!). It's just to get you *started*.\n",
    "+ These exercises ask you to compare **multiple** training runs, so it is **really** important that you factor this into your **pipeline**. Using [Tensorboard](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/recipes/recipes/tensorboard_with_pytorch.html) is a **very** good idea -- or, even better [Weights and Biases](https://wandb.ai/site).\n",
